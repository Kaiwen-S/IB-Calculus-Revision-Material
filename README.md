# IB-Calculus-Revision-Material
This is a short document that I created to help my classmates on the core topic Calculus of IB math HL.

The major part of this document is still incomplete. Here is a list of incomplete sections:
1. Integral by substitution
2. Integral by parts
3. ODEs (first order & second order)
4. Reduction formula

Any suggestion on how to write these sections will be appreciated, and if you have anything to add to the preceding section, please feel free to do so.

If you figure out any typo/error, please contact me directly if you're my classmate, or fork this project and pull relevant requests. Thank you in advance.
